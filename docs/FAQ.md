# 1. What is the Atlas Project?
Atlas strides to be one of the best modifications of the Windows Operating System. To give the best performance and privacy, while still giving functionality.
The difference between Atlas and other ISOs is that we are "Open-Source", we provided all the tools we use and resources to help you make your own.
Our main tool is NTLite which is closed-source and paid. In the future we hope to provide a script to help you make Atlas yourself at no cost.
