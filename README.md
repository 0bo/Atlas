# Atlas
An open and transparent modification of the Windows 10 operating system, designed to optimize performance and latency.


### What are the benefits compared to regular windows?

#### **Private**
Atlas attempts to remove all types of tracking embedded within Windows 10. Though some features are not/cannot private, such as:
- Microsoft Store
- Linked Microsoft Account
- Xbox
- Some apps and services not deployed by Atlas
- Websites you visit.

#### **Secure**
Atlas aims to be "Secure by Default" meaning, disabling features that can leak information or be exploited. There are exceptins to this such as [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) and [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf). These mitigations are disabled to improve performance.
If a security mitigation decreases performance, it will be disabled.

#### **Debloated**
Atlas is heavily stripped, preinstalled apps and other components are removed. This can break some compatability, but can be [re-added.](https://WIKILINKTOBE.ADDED) This significantly reduces ISO and install size. Functionalities such as Printing, are removed. This modification is focused on pure gaming, but most work and education applications work. As mentioned before, if you need a certain functionality, you have the option to add this by [re-adding compatability.](https://WIKILINKTOBE.ADDED)

#### **Performant**
Atlas is pre-tweaked. We've done almost everything to squeeze out the most performance, minimize latency and input lag.
We've done the following to do this:
- Custom Powerplan
- Minimized Services
- Disabled Drivers
- Disabled Devices
- Disabling Performance-Hungry Security Mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI Mode
