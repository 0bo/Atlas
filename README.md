### What are the benefits compared to regular windows?

#### **Private**
Atlas attempts to remove all types of tracking embedded within Windows 10. Though some features are not/cannot private, such as:
- Microsoft Store
- Linked Microsoft Account
- Xbox
- Some apps and services not deployed by Atlas 

#### **Secure**
Atlas aims to be "Secure by Default" meaning, disabling features that can leak information or be exploited. The only exception to this is [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) and [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf). These mitigations are disabled to improve performance.
The guidline on preference is Performance > Security, so any mitigations that can cause a major loss in performance will be disabled.

#### **Debloated**
Atlas is heavily stripped, preinstalled apps and other components are removed. This can break some compatability, but can be [re-added.](https://WIKILINKTOBE.ADDED) This significantly reduces ISO and install size. Functionalities such as Printing, are removed. This modification is focused on pure gaming and some work. As mentioned before, if you need a certain functionality, you have the ability to add this by [re-adding compatability.](https://WIKILINKTOBE.ADDED)

#### **Performant**
Atlas is pre-tweaked. Services, drivers, powerplan, msi-mode (***soon***), and more are already integrated.
